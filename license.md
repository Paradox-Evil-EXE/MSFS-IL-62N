# IL-62N Temporary License Notice

This project is in a **pre-license phase**.

It includes content originally derived from legacy FSX aircraft packages. As the original creators of these assets are currently unreachable (Project tupolev long left the flight simulator communities), this repository and its content are shared **for educational and non-commercial (eg: personal) purposes only**.

No part of this project may be sold, monetized, or redistributed outside this repository without explicit permission from all original asset creators.

If you are the creator or owner of any included assets and wish to clarify licensing or request removal, please contact us via DMing me on discord (evil.exe_main) or the project [Discord](https://discord.gg/x52mwgyCBU).

This file will be updated when license status is confirmed.
