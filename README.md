# IL‑62N – Native IL‑62 for Microsoft Flight Simulator

A lightweight, community-driven rebuild of the legendary Soviet IL‑62 as a **native MSFS aircraft**. Based on a legacy FSX import, the goal is to restore flight stability, build a working cockpit, and keep the flying fridge alive — without overcomplicating it.

> Rebuilding the fridge that fought physics and history.

## 🚧 Current Status
- ✅ Imported model loads in MSFS
## ❌ Problems
- No working cockpit instruments
- No native flight systems or WASM logic
- Reversers deploy *automatically* at rotate and/or other moments on the ground (yes, really)
- Engine randomly goes to idle on runway
- Flaps sometimes retract without command during takeoff roll

---

## 🛠️ Goals
- Slight cockpit remodel to house usable gauges
- Rewrite engine logic for correct thrust behavior
- Animate and implement working instruments
- Fix weird flap/autothrottle bugs
- Keep it simple, clean, and fun — no overengineered bloat
- **⚠️ Heads up**: This is a zero-budget project. I’m broke, you’re broke (probably), the IL-62 is broke — we’re all here just to make something cool happen. No payments, just credit and community, and the sight of the great bird in the air again.
