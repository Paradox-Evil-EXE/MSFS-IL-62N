# IL‚Äë62N ‚Äì Native IL‚Äë62 for Microsoft Flight Simulator

A lightweight, community-driven rebuild of the legendary Soviet IL‚Äë62 as a **native MSFS aircraft**. Based on a legacy FSX import, the goal is to restore flight stability, build a working cockpit, and keep the flying fridge alive ‚Äî without overcomplicating it.

> Bringing the infamous bird back from the dead, in a modern flight simulator

## üöß Current Status
- ‚úÖ Imported model loads in MSFS
## ‚ùå Problems
- No working cockpit instruments
- No native flight systems or WASM logic
- Reversers deploy *automatically* at rotate and/or other moments on the ground (yes, really, not all the times either, worth checking out)
- Engine randomly goes to idle on runway sometimes
- Flaps sometimes retract without command during takeoff roll sometimes
## ‚úÖ Fixed
- Barely any lift power, struggles to takeoff  
  - Increased `lift_scalar` to `1.200` for `[FLAPS.0]`  
  - Increased `thrust_scalar` to `1.250` for `[JET_ENGINE]`

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Goals
- Slight cockpit remodel to house usable gauges
- Rewrite engine logic for correct thrust behavior
- Animate and implement working instruments
- Fix weird flap/autothrottle bugs
- Keep it simple, clean, and fun ‚Äî no overengineered bloat

---

## **‚ö†Ô∏è Heads up**:
This is a zero-budget project. I‚Äôm broke, you‚Äôre broke (probably), the IL-62 is broke(n) ‚Äî we‚Äôre all here just to make something cool happen. No payments, just credit and community, and the sight of the great bird in the air again.

## ü§ù How to Help
Looking for contributors who can help with:
- 3D cockpit modeling (just tweaks, not a full redo)
- Flight model tuning & engine config
- Gauge/instrument animation
- Replacing legacy FSX behavior with native MSFS systems
- If you want to try editing or flying it yourself, [download the current version here via The mirror](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XArml0h0QlA1kpqCrtPvFI85L_47ZvMp/view?usp=sharing).  
  - This link will be kept updated to match the fixes and problems listed in this README.
